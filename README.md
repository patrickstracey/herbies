# Herbies

This project is the outcome of a front-end programming test for a front-end role using Angular. The requirements of the test are listed below.

*October 2021*

### The Test

Hello and thank you so much for your interest in a front-end role on the software engineering team here at {{company name}}.

As part of our hiring process here we ask all candidates to take on a small front-end project so that we can better understand where your understanding of Angular and Typescript currently lie. This helps us better understand what your onboarding would look like and helps us tailor our interview process to your experience level.

**The Project:** We would like you to create a simple blog project from scratch utilizing Angular10+. Mock data is being provided in the form of json and the project should include the following three pages:

- Index page that lists all the blog posts
- Detail page that displays the selected post, itâ€™s hero image, author, and published date
- Post creation page with a form for inputting a title and body for a new post that can then be added

*There should also be a method to delete or edit existing posts, but how you implement this is totally up to you!*

The project should be generated from scratch using the Angular CLI and the index, detail, and post creation pages should live on different routes. It should be hosted on a site like Github or Bitbucket for review as a public repo.


*Remember:* You only need to build the front-end for this so feel free to use the fake data provided and keep everything stored on the front-end. Building a back-end API is not wanted for this project.

## Development server

After installing, run `ng serve` for a dev server. The default is normally `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
